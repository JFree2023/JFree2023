--> I self studied python for a couple months last year. I used python crash course and IDLE instructions.
I wanted to take this class to learn Javascript and get a foundation for learning more code in the future. I also think I would learn faster enrolling in a school course than doing it on my own. I like to play chess, card games, video games, read, and play sports. I have high academic goals this year because it's my senior year.
